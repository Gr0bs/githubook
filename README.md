## :clipboard: **About this project**

In order to learn React, I first create this App to improve my skills. But.... I would like to try VueJs for work opportunities.
So I decided to re-create the project in VueJs. 

**But what's the project ?**
Everyone loves social media.. I'm sure you open Fb or Twitter or Instragram today. 
So why not created a social media base of developer's work ? :bulb: 
Github Api provide any informations about ours repositories, like commites message, hours, date, etc.. Whith all of theses informations we
can have a *Facebook / instagram* like. This is what's this project is ! 

## :bulb: **Why** 
I don't like create something that everyone created. 
When you search for a app to create in VueJs/ReactJS when your start, it's always "Todo APP", "Weather App" or "Blog"... But that's not really funny and many times the informations are fakes..  

## :map: **Roadmap**  
 - Implementing Github OAuth in order to connect your github profile  
 - Creating Post   
 - Adding like to a post / Respond to a Post  
 - wait for it....
